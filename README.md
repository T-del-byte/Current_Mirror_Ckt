# CURRENT_MIRROR_CIRCUIT
# Objective 
To create a clone of the model of current mirror to show a current through one active device by controlling the current in another active device of a circuit, keeping the output current constant regardless of loading.
# Tools & technologies
Transistor, breadboard, Led bulb, resistor
# Working Principle
- Two transistors (Q1 and Q2) are arranged such that their bases and emitters are tied together.  
- A reference current is established . Due to the matching of the base-emitter voltages, the same current ideally producing 
# Construction
- Choosed two matched NPN transistors (Q1 and Q2).  
- Connected the collector of Q1 to Vcc through a resistor (Rref) to establish a reference current.  
- Tied the bases of Q1 and Q2 together.  
- Connected the emitters of Q1 and Q2 to ground.  
- Connected the collector of Q2 to the output node to mirror the current into the load.
- Leds are connted to the jucntion to see weather the current flowing through the transister or not.
# Output
The final output of the current mirror circuit is a mirrored current that is ideally equal or proportional to the reference current.
# Key Features
Current Copying, Simple Implementation, Precision, Scalability.
# Applications
Biasing, Active Loads, Differential Amplifiers, Current Steering.
